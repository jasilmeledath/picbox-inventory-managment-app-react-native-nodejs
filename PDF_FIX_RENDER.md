# PDF Generation Fix for Render - October 14, 2025

## 🐛 Problem Solved

**Error:** `Could not find Chrome (ver. 141.0.7390.76)`

PDF generation failed because Render didn't have Chrome/Chromium installed.

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

### Changes Made:

1. **Created `backend/build.sh`**
   - Installs Chromium during deployment
   - Command: `npx puppeteer browsers install chrome`

2. **Updated `render.yaml`**
   - Build command: `./build.sh` (instead of `npm install`)

3. **Enhanced Puppeteer Config**
   - Added production args: `--single-process`, `--disable-gpu`
   - Optimized for Render's environment

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Render Will Auto-Deploy:
1. ✅ Code pushed to GitHub
