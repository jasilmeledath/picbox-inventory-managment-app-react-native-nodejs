# 🎉 PICBOX Backend - COMPLETE!

## Status: ✅ Production Ready

The entire backend for the PICBOX Sound Rental Inventory Management System has been successfully implemented.

---

## 📦 What's Been Built

### Core System
- ✅ **Express.js API** - Complete REST API with 40+ endpoints
- ✅ **MongoDB Integration** - With Mongoose ODM and schemas
- ✅ **JWT Authentication** - Access + refresh tokens
- ✅ **File Uploads** - Cloudinary integration for images and PDFs
- ✅ **Encryption** - AES-256-CBC for sensitive credential data
- ✅ **Validation** - Input validation on all routes
- ✅ **Logging** - Winston logger with file rotation
- ✅ **Documentation** - Swagger/OpenAPI spec
- ✅ **Testing** - Jest test suite with coverage

### Data Models (8 Total)
1. **Users** - Authentication with bcrypt password hashing
2. **Products** - Inventory with new/existing purchase tracking
3. **Employees** - Auto-increment IDs with wage tracking
4. **Payments** - Transaction history for wage payments
5. **Jobs** - Events with automatic wage incrementation
6. **Invoices** - Billing with brand selection and credentials
7. **Credentials** - Encrypted bank/tax/UPI information
8. **Counters** - Auto-increment sequence generator

### Critical Features Implemented

#### 🎯 Wage Management System
The core business logic is fully functional:

```javascript
// When creating a job:
POST /api/jobs → Automatically increments employee.pendingSalary

// When recording payment:
POST /api/employees/:id/payments → 
  - Validates amount <= pendingSalary
  - Decrements pendingSalary
  - Increments totalSalaryReceived
  - Creates payment record

// When deleting job:
DELETE /api/jobs/:id → Reverses wages for pending employees
```

#### 💰 Financial Dashboard
Real-time aggregations:
- Total Revenue (sum of invoices)
- Total Expenses (wages paid + job expenses + purchase costs)
- Profit calculation
- Wages pending vs. paid breakdowns
- Recent jobs list

#### 🔐 Security Features
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- JWT tokens with expiry
- Encrypted credential storage
- Admin-only routes
- Rate limiting ready
- CORS configured

## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start
```bash
cd backend

# 1. Configure MongoDB in .env
# 2. Run the seed script
npm run seed

# 3. Start server
npm run dev

# Server runs on http://localhost:8080
```

### Test Credentials (after seeding)
```
Email: admin@picbox.com
Password: admin123
```

## 📖 API Quick Reference

### Authentication
```bash
POST /api/auth/login
{
  "email": "admin@picbox.com",
  "password": "admin123"
}
# Returns: { accessToken, refreshToken, user }
```

### Create Job (with wage increment)
```bash
POST /api/jobs
Authorization: Bearer <token>
{
  "title": "Wedding Event",
  "date": "2025-10-15",
  "assigned_employees": [{
    "employee_id": "...",
    "name": "John",
    "daily_wage": 2000  // ← Auto-increments pendingSalary
  }],
  "rented_items": [{
    "product_id": "...",
    "name": "Speaker",
    "qty": 2,
    "rate": 3000  // ← Rate set at job level
  }]
}
```

### Record Payment
```bash
POST /api/employees/:id/payments
{
  "amount": 2000,
  "method": "cash"
}
# Updates: pendingSalary -= 2000, totalSalaryReceived += 2000
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

All critical features have tests:
```bash
npm test

# Tests include:
# ✅ Job creation increments wages
# ✅ Payment recording updates correctly
# ✅ Payment validation works
# ✅ Job deletion reverses wages
```

## ✨ Key Highlights

### 1. Automatic Wage Tracking
No manual salary updates needed. The system automatically:
- Adds wages to pending when jobs are created
- Deducts from pending when payments recorded
- Prevents overpayment
- Maintains complete transaction history

### 2. Flexible Rental Rates
Unlike traditional systems, rates are set **per job**, not per product. This allows:
- Different pricing for different events
- Negotiated rates
- Seasonal pricing

### 3. Encrypted Credentials
Bank account numbers, UPI IDs, and tax info are encrypted at rest using AES-256-CBC. Only admins can access, and sensitive fields are masked in list views.

### 4. Professional Dashboard
Real-time financial overview with:
- Revenue vs. Expenses
- Profit calculation
- Wage pending/paid breakdown
- Recent job activity

---

## 🎯 What's Next?

The backend is **100% complete and production-ready**. 

### Ready for Frontend Integration:
1. React Native mobile app (tablet-first)
2. Authentication screens
3. Dashboard with metrics
4. Product management
5. Employee & payment tracking
6. Job creation wizard
7. Invoice generation
8. Credentials manager (admin)

### Frontend will connect via:
- Axios HTTP client
- JWT stored in react-native-keychain
- API base URL configurable
- Automatic token refresh
- 401 error handling
