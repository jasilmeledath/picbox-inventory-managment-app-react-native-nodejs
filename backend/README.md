## üê≥ Docker Deployment

Build image:
```bash
docker build -t picbox-backend .
```

Run container:
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env picbox-backend
```

2. Create new Web Service on Render
3. Connect repository
4. Configure:
   - Build Command: `npm install`
   - Start Command: `npm start`
   - Add environment variables
5. Deploy!

## üìä Database Schema

See `src/models/` for detailed schemas:
- Users (authentication)
- Products (inventory)
- Employees (wage tracking)
- Jobs (events with wages)
- Invoices (billing)
- Credentials (encrypted)
- Payments (transaction history)
- Counters (auto-increment)

## üîß Key Business Logic

### Wage Management
- **Job Creation**: Automatically increments `employee.pendingSalary`
- **Payment Recording**: Decrements `pendingSalary`, increments `totalSalaryReceived`
- **Job Deletion**: Reverses pending wages
- **Job Update**: Adjusts wages if employees changed

### Financial Tracking
- **Revenue**: Sum of all invoice amounts
- **Expenses**: Wages paid + job expenses + new product costs
- **Profit**: Revenue - Expenses

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### MongoDB Connection Issues
```bash
# Check MongoDB URI format
mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/dbname
```

### Cloudinary Upload Errors
- Verify API credentials
- Check file size limits (5MB images, 10MB PDFs)

### JWT Token Errors
- Ensure JWT_SECRET is set
- Check token expiration settings
