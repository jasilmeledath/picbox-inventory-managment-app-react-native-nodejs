## Quick Test Script

Run this to verify key functionality:

```bash
# 1. Start server
npm run dev

# 2. In another terminal, test endpoints:

# Health check
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@picbox.com","password":"admin123"}'

# Copy the accessToken from response, then:

# Get dashboard (replace TOKEN)
curl http://localhost:8080/api/dashboard/summary \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"

# List employees
curl http://localhost:8080/api/employees \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
```

## Common Issues & Fixes

### MongoDB Connection Failed
```bash
# Check MongoDB is running
brew services list | grep mongodb

# Or check connection string format
mongodb://localhost:27017/picbox  # Local
mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.net/picbox  # Atlas
```

### JWT Errors
```bash
# Regenerate secret
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"
# Update JWT_SECRET in .env
```

### Encryption Key Error
```bash
# Generate valid key (64 hex characters)
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
# Update ENCRYPTION_KEY in .env
```

### Port Already in Use
```bash
# Find process on port 8080
lsof -ti:8080

# Kill process
kill -9 $(lsof -ti:8080)

# Or change PORT in .env
```

## Performance Baseline

Expected response times (local):
- Health check: < 10ms
- Auth login: < 100ms
- Product list: < 50ms
- Job creation: < 200ms (includes wage updates)
- Dashboard summary: < 150ms (aggregations)

If slower, check:
- Database indexes created
- MongoDB connection pool size
- Network latency to MongoDB

## Ready for Frontend?

Once all items checked, the backend is ready for React Native integration!

Frontend will need:
1. Backend URL (local or production)
2. Admin credentials for testing
3. API endpoint documentation
4. JWT token handling strategy
5. Error response format understanding
