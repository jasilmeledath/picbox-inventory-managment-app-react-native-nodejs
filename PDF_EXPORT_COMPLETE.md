## üîß Technical Details

### Backend Endpoints:

```
Company Credentials:
GET    /api/company-credentials                    - Get all
GET    /api/company-credentials/by-name/:name      - Get by name (Picbox/Echo)
POST   /api/company-credentials                    - Create (multipart/form-data)
PATCH  /api/company-credentials/:id                - Update (multipart/form-data)
DELETE /api/company-credentials/:id                - Delete

Invoice PDF:
POST   /api/invoices/:id/generate-pdf              - Generate and upload PDF
```

### PDF Generation Flow:

1. **Frontend** calls `/api/invoices/:id/generate-pdf`
2. **Backend** fetches invoice with populated items
3. **Backend** fetches company credential based on `brand_type`
4. **Generate UPI QR Code** (if UPI ID exists and pending amount > 0)
5. **Render HTML template** with all data
6. **Puppeteer** converts HTML to PDF buffer
7. **Upload PDF** to Cloudinary
8. **Save PDF URL** to invoice document
9. **Return** invoice with PDF URL

### UPI QR Code Format:
```
upi://pay?pa=<UPI_ID>&pn=<PAYEE_NAME>&am=<AMOUNT>&cu=INR
```

---

## üì± Frontend Usage (For Testing)

### Generate PDF from Invoice Detail:

```typescript
import { invoiceService } from '../../api/invoice.service';

const handleGeneratePDF = async (invoiceId: string) => {
  try {
    setGenerating(true);
    const updatedInvoice = await invoiceService.generatePDF(invoiceId);
    
    if (updatedInvoice.pdf?.url) {
      Alert.alert('Success', 'PDF generated successfully!');
      // Open PDF URL or share
    }
  } catch (error: any) {
    Alert.alert('Error', error.message || 'Failed to generate PDF');
  } finally {
    setGenerating(false);
  }
};
```

## ‚úÖ Testing Checklist

### Backend Testing:
- [ ] Start backend server: `cd backend && npm start`
- [ ] Test company credential creation via Postman
- [ ] Test PDF generation endpoint
- [ ] Check Cloudinary for uploaded PDFs
- [ ] Verify QR code generation

### Frontend Testing:
- [ ] Configure Picbox company credentials in Settings
- [ ] Configure Echo company credentials in Settings
- [ ] Create a Picbox invoice
- [ ] Generate PDF for Picbox invoice
- [ ] Create an Echo invoice
- [ ] Generate PDF for Echo invoice
- [ ] Verify different statuses (draft/estimate/final)

## üé® PDF Design Features

### Color Scheme:
- **Picbox**: Purple (#7C3AED)
- **Echo**: Purple variant (#8B5CF6)
- **Draft**: Gray (#6B7280)

---

## üîê Security Considerations

- Company credentials are NOT encrypted (unlike payment credentials)
- Stored in separate `CompanyCredential` model
- Only authenticated users can access
- Logo files uploaded to Cloudinary (public but obscured URLs)
- PDF files uploaded to Cloudinary with secure URLs

---

## üìù Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Add logo picker** to company credentials screen
2. **PDF preview** before generation
3. **Email invoice** functionality
4. **WhatsApp share** integration
5. **Download PDF** to device
6. **Custom templates** per company
7. **Multi-language** support
8. **Custom notes** field in invoice
9. **Discount/Tax** calculations
10. **Payment terms** and due dates

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### PDF Generation Fails:
- **Check**: Company credentials are configured for the brand
- **Check**: Backend has Cloudinary credentials in `.env`
- **Check**: Puppeteer is properly installed (`npm install puppeteer`)
- **Check**: Server has enough memory (Puppeteer needs ~200MB)

### QR Code Not Showing:
- **Check**: UPI ID is configured in company credentials
- **Check**: Pending amount > 0
- **Check**: `qrcode` package is installed

### Logo Not Showing in PDF:
- **Check**: Logo is uploaded to company credential
- **Check**: Logo URL is accessible (test in browser)
- **Solution**: Use Cloudinary URLs or base64 encoded images
