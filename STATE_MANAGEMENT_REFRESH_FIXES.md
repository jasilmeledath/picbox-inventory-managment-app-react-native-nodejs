# State Management & Pull-to-Refresh Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Employee Wages Not Reflecting Live ✅
**Problem:** After completing a job and adding employee wages, the pending salary in the Employees screen didn't update until the app was restarted.

**Root Cause:** No automatic refresh mechanism when navigating between tabs. The JobsScreen creates job with wages, but EmployeesScreen didn't know to refresh its data.

**Solution:** Implemented `useFocusEffect` hook to automatically refresh employee data whenever the Employees screen comes into focus (when user navigates to it).

```typescript
// frontend/src/screens/employees/EmployeesScreen.tsx
import { useFocusEffect } from '@react-navigation/native';

// Refresh when screen comes into focus
useFocusEffect(
  React.useCallback(() => {
    fetchEmployees(searchQuery);
  }, [searchQuery])
);
```

**How it works:**
1. User creates/completes job in Jobs tab → Wages added to employees
2. User switches to Employees tab
3. `useFocusEffect` triggers automatically
4. `fetchEmployees()` called → Fresh data loaded from backend
5. Pending salaries now show updated amounts ✅

---

### Issue 2: Pull-to-Refresh Missing on Multiple Screens ✅
**Problem:** Dashboard had pull-to-refresh, but Employees, Jobs, Products, and Invoices screens didn't support the down-swipe refresh gesture.

**Solution:** Added `RefreshControl` component to all FlatLists across all tab screens.

---

## Changes Made by Screen

### 1. Employees Screen ✅
**File:** `frontend/src/screens/employees/EmployeesScreen.tsx`

**Added:**
- ✅ `RefreshControl` import
- ✅ `useFocusEffect` import
- ✅ `refreshing` state variable
- ✅ `onRefresh()` handler function
- ✅ `useFocusEffect` hook for auto-refresh on focus
- ✅ `RefreshControl` component on FlatList

```typescript
// Imports
import { RefreshControl } from 'react-native';
import { useFocusEffect } from '@react-navigation/native';

// State
const [refreshing, setRefreshing] = useState(false);

// Auto-refresh on focus (fixes wage update issue)
useFocusEffect(
  React.useCallback(() => {
    fetchEmployees(searchQuery);
  }, [searchQuery])
);

// Pull to refresh handler
const onRefresh = async () => {
  setRefreshing(true);
  await fetchEmployees(searchQuery);
  setRefreshing(false);
};

// FlatList with RefreshControl
<FlatList
  data={employees}
  refreshControl={
    <RefreshControl
      refreshing={refreshing}
      onRefresh={onRefresh}
      colors={[colors.primary]}
      tintColor={colors.primary}
    />
  }
  ...
/>
```

---

### 2. Jobs Screen ✅
**File:** `frontend/src/screens/jobs/JobsScreen.tsx`

**Added:**
- ✅ `RefreshControl` import
- ✅ `useFocusEffect` import  
- ✅ `refreshing` state variable
- ✅ `onRefresh()` handler function
- ✅ `useFocusEffect` hook to refresh jobs AND employees
- ✅ `RefreshControl` component on FlatList

```typescript
// State
const [refreshing, setRefreshing] = useState(false);

// Auto-refresh on focus (refreshes both jobs and employees)
useFocusEffect(
  React.useCallback(() => {
    loadJobs();
    fetchEmployees(); // Refresh employees to get updated pending salary
  }, [])
);

// Pull to refresh handler (refreshes all data)
const onRefresh = async () => {
  setRefreshing(true);
  try {
    await Promise.all([
      loadJobs(),
      fetchEmployees(),
      fetchProducts(),
    ]);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Refresh failed:', error);
  } finally {
    setRefreshing(false);
  }
};

// FlatList with RefreshControl
<FlatList
  data={jobs}
  refreshControl={
    <RefreshControl
      refreshing={refreshing}
      onRefresh={onRefresh}
      colors={[colors.primary]}
      tintColor={colors.primary}
    />
  }
  ...
/>
```

**Key Feature:** Jobs screen refreshes BOTH jobs and employees on focus. This ensures if you create a job with wages, then switch to Employees tab, the data is already fresh.

---

### 3. Products Screen ✅
**File:** `frontend/src/screens/products/ProductsScreen.tsx`

**Added:**
- ✅ `RefreshControl` import
- ✅ `refreshing` state variable
- ✅ `onRefresh()` handler function
- ✅ `RefreshControl` component on FlatList

```typescript
// State
const [refreshing, setRefreshing] = useState(false);

// Pull to refresh handler
const onRefresh = async () => {
  setRefreshing(true);
  await fetchProducts(searchQuery);
  setRefreshing(false);
};

// FlatList with RefreshControl
<FlatList
  data={products}
  refreshControl={
    <RefreshControl
      refreshing={refreshing}
      onRefresh={onRefresh}
      colors={[colors.primary]}
      tintColor={colors.primary}
    />
  }
  ...
/>
```

---

### 4. Invoices Screen ✅
**File:** `frontend/src/screens/invoices/InvoicesScreen.tsx`

**Added:**
- ✅ `RefreshControl` import
- ✅ `refreshing` state variable
- ✅ `onRefresh()` handler function
- ✅ `RefreshControl` component on FlatList

```typescript
// State
const [refreshing, setRefreshing] = useState(false);

// Pull to refresh handler (refreshes invoices and products)
const onRefresh = async () => {
  setRefreshing(true);
  try {
    await Promise.all([
      loadInvoices(),
      fetchProducts(),
    ]);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Refresh failed:', error);
  } finally {
    setRefreshing(false);
  }
};

// FlatList with RefreshControl
<FlatList
  data={invoices}
  refreshControl={
    <RefreshControl
      refreshing={refreshing}
      onRefresh={onRefresh}
      colors={[colors.primary]}
      tintColor={colors.primary}
    />
  }
  ...
/>
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### useFocusEffect vs useEffect

**useEffect:**
- Runs once when component mounts
- Doesn't re-run when navigating back to the screen
- ❌ Doesn't solve stale data issue

**useFocusEffect:**
- Runs every time the screen comes into focus
- Perfect for tab navigation scenarios
- ✅ Ensures fresh data when switching tabs

```typescript
// OLD (doesn't refresh on tab switch)
useEffect(() => {
  fetchEmployees();
}, []);

// NEW (refreshes every time you navigate to the tab)
useFocusEffect(
  React.useCallback(() => {
    fetchEmployees();
  }, [])
);
```

### RefreshControl Component

**Props:**
- `refreshing` - Boolean state to show/hide spinner
- `onRefresh` - Function called when user pulls down
- `colors` - Spinner color (Android)
- `tintColor` - Spinner color (iOS)

**User Experience:**
1. User pulls down on list
2. Spinner appears
3. `onRefresh()` function executes
4. Fresh data loaded from API
5. `setRefreshing(false)` hides spinner
6. List updates with new data

---

## State Management Flow

### Before Fix:
```
1. Jobs Screen: Complete job with wages
   ↓
2. Backend: Saves job, updates employee pending_salary
   ↓
3. Switch to Employees tab
   ↓
4. Employees Screen: Shows OLD cached data ❌
   ↓
5. User must restart app to see updated wages ❌
```

### After Fix:
```
1. Jobs Screen: Complete job with wages
   ↓
2. Backend: Saves job, updates employee pending_salary
   ↓
3. Jobs Screen: useFocusEffect refreshes employees
   ↓
4. Switch to Employees tab
   ↓
5. Employees Screen: useFocusEffect triggers
   ↓
6. fetchEmployees() called
   ↓
7. Fresh data loaded from backend ✅
   ↓
8. Updated wages displayed immediately ✅
```

---

## Pull-to-Refresh Flow

```
User pulls down on list
   ↓
RefreshControl detects gesture
   ↓
onRefresh() called
   ↓
setRefreshing(true) - Shows spinner
   ↓
API calls execute (fetchEmployees, loadJobs, etc.)
   ↓
Fresh data received from backend
   ↓
State updated with new data
   ↓
setRefreshing(false) - Hides spinner
   ↓
FlatList re-renders with fresh data
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented:

1. **useCallback Dependency Arrays:**
   ```typescript
   useFocusEffect(
     React.useCallback(() => {
       fetchEmployees(searchQuery);
     }, [searchQuery]) // Only recreate if searchQuery changes
   );
   ```

2. **Parallel API Calls:**
   ```typescript
   await Promise.all([
     loadJobs(),
     fetchEmployees(),
     fetchProducts(),
   ]); // All requests happen simultaneously
   ```

3. **Debouncing (Existing):**
   - Search queries already debounced
   - Prevents excessive API calls while typing

4. **State Management:**
   - Using Zustand stores for efficient state updates
   - Prevents unnecessary re-renders

- ✅ Always see fresh, accurate information
- ✅ Consistent UX across all tabs

### For Development:
- ✅ Proper state synchronization

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Too many API calls
**Solution:** useFocusEffect already uses useCallback to prevent excessive calls. Only fires when screen comes into focus.

### Issue: Infinite loop
**Solution:** Dependency arrays in useCallback prevent infinite re-renders.

### Issue: Data not updating
**Solution:** Check if Zustand store is updating correctly. Verify API response.

### Issue: Spinner stuck
**Solution:** Ensure setRefreshing(false) is called in finally block to handle errors.
