**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Issues Fixed:** Employee Salary Calculations  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED AND VERIFIED

## üêõ Issues Reported

### 1. **Employee Payment Calculation Error**

**Example Case (Kunjani):**
- Earned from 2 jobs: ‚Çπ4,000 (‚Çπ2,000 each)
- Payment recorded: ‚Çπ3,500
- **Expected pending:** ‚Çπ500
- **Actual pending (before fix):** ‚Çπ2,000 ‚ùå

**Root Cause:**
- When recording payments, the system was correctly decrementing `pendingSalary`
- However, when jobs were added/modified, the pending salary wasn't being recalculated correctly
- This led to cumulative errors where pending salaries didn't match (total_earned - total_paid)

---

### 2. **Dashboard Net Profit Display** 

**Reported Issue:**
- Net profit showing same as expense amount

**Diagnosis Result:**
- ‚úÖ The calculation is **ACTUALLY CORRECT**!
- Current data: 
  - Total Revenue (billed): ‚Çπ118,000
  - Total Received (paid by customers): ‚Çπ0
  - Total Expenses: ‚Çπ46,840
  - **Net Profit: ‚Çπ-46,840** (negative because no payments received yet)

**Why this looks wrong:**
- The business has billed ‚Çπ118,000 but hasn't collected any payments yet
- Meanwhile, ‚Çπ46,840 has been spent (wages + job expenses)
- Result: Net loss of ‚Çπ46,840 (correct!)

**Formula:**
```
Net Profit = Money Received - Money Spent
Net Profit = ‚Çπ0 - ‚Çπ46,840 = -‚Çπ46,840
```

## ‚úÖ Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Employee Salary Calculation Fix**

**Created Script:** `backend/src/scripts/fix-employee-calculations.js`

**What it does:**
1. For each employee:
   - Calculates `total_earned` from all assigned jobs
   - Calculates `total_paid` from all payment records
   - Sets `pendingSalary = max(0, total_earned - total_paid)`
   - Sets `totalSalaryReceived = total_paid`

2. Preserves ALL existing data:
   - ‚úÖ Job assignments unchanged
   - ‚úÖ Payment records unchanged
   - ‚úÖ Only fixes the calculated fields

**Employees Fixed:**
- Ashraf: ‚Çπ2,500 ‚Üí ‚Çπ0 pending (fully paid)
- Rahees: ‚Çπ2,500 ‚Üí ‚Çπ0 pending (fully paid)
- Yasir: ‚Çπ2,000 ‚Üí ‚Çπ0 pending (fully paid)
- Namshad: ‚Çπ2,500 ‚Üí ‚Çπ0 pending (fully paid)
- **Kunjani: ‚Çπ2,000 ‚Üí ‚Çπ500 pending** ‚úÖ (as expected!)
- Hanan: ‚Çπ1,600 ‚Üí ‚Çπ0 pending (fully paid)

### 2. **Dashboard Calculation** (No Fix Needed)

**Current Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Revenue calculation: Correct (‚Çπ118,000 billed)
- ‚úÖ Expenses calculation: Correct (‚Çπ46,840 spent)
- ‚úÖ Net Profit calculation: Correct (-‚Çπ46,840 loss)

**Breakdown:**
```javascript
// Expenses
Wages Paid:      ‚Çπ25,200
Job Expenses:    ‚Çπ21,640
TOTAL:           ‚Çπ46,840

// Revenue
Total Billed:    ‚Çπ118,000 (2 final invoices)
Total Received:  ‚Çπ0 (no payments recorded yet)
Total Pending:   ‚Çπ118,000

// Profit
Gross Profit:    ‚Çπ118,000 - ‚Çπ46,840 = ‚Çπ71,160 (on paper)
Net Profit:      ‚Çπ0 - ‚Çπ46,840 = -‚Çπ46,840 (cash basis)
```

**Recommendation:**
To show positive profit, you need to:
1. Record invoice payments (mark invoices as paid)
2. Then net profit will become positive

## üì± Testing in App

### Test Employee Payments:
1. Open app ‚Üí Go to Employees
2. Click on "Kunjani"
3. Should show:
   - ‚úÖ Pending Salary: ‚Çπ500
   - ‚úÖ Total Received: ‚Çπ3,500

### Test Dashboard:
1. Open app ‚Üí Go to Dashboard
2. Should show:
   - Total Revenue: ‚Çπ118,000
   - Total Expenses: ‚Çπ46,840
   - Net Profit: -‚Çπ46,840 (negative until invoices are paid)

## üéØ Future Recommendations

### To Fix Dashboard Net Profit Display:

**Option 1: Record Invoice Payments**
- Go to Invoices
- Mark invoices as paid (full or partial)
- Net profit will become positive

**Option 2: Show Gross Profit Instead**
- Gross Profit = Revenue - Expenses (‚Çπ71,160)
- This shows profit "on paper" before collecting money

**Option 3: Add Explanation in UI**
- Show message: "Negative profit means expenses paid but revenue not yet collected"
