# FileSystem API Deprecation Fix ✅

**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Issue:** `downloadAsync` deprecated error when downloading PDF

## Error Message

```
Error

Method downloadAsync imported from 'expo-file-system' is deprecated.

You can migrate to the new filesystem API using "File" and "Directory" 
classes or import the legacy API from "expo-file-system/legacy".

API reference and examples are available in the filesystem docs: 
https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v54.0.0/sdk/filesystem/
```

## Root Cause

Expo SDK 54 introduced a new filesystem API and deprecated the old `downloadAsync` method. The app was importing from `expo-file-system` which now uses the new API by default.

## Solution

Changed the import to use the legacy API which maintains backward compatibility:

### Before:
```typescript
import * as FileSystem from 'expo-file-system';
```

### After:
```typescript
import * as FileSystem from 'expo-file-system/legacy';
```

## File Changed

**File:** `frontend/src/api/invoice.service.ts`

**Line 2:**
```typescript
import * as FileSystem from 'expo-file-system/legacy';
```

This maintains the existing `downloadAsync` functionality without requiring code refactoring.

## Why Legacy API?

Using the legacy API is perfectly fine because:

1. ✅ **Still Supported** - Expo maintains legacy exports for backward compatibility
2. ✅ **Stable** - The downloadAsync method is battle-tested and reliable
3. ✅ **Simple** - Works exactly as expected without code changes
4. ✅ **No Breaking Changes** - App continues working immediately

## Alternative (Future Migration)

If you want to use the new filesystem API in the future, here's how:

```typescript
import { File, Directory } from 'expo-file-system';

// New API approach (more modern)
async generatePDF(id: string, customerName: string, invoiceNumber: number) {
  const fileName = `invoice_${invoiceNumber}_${customerName}.pdf`;
  const directory = Directory.documentsDirectory;
  const file = new File(directory, fileName);
  
  // Fetch PDF from server
  const response = await fetch(
    `${baseURL}/invoices/${id}/generate-pdf`,
    { headers: authHeaders }
  );
  
  const blob = await response.blob();
  await file.write(blob);
  
  // Share the file
  await Sharing.shareAsync(file.uri);
}
```

But for now, the legacy API works perfectly! ✅

## Testing

### Try Again:

1. **Reload the app** (the change should hot-reload automatically)
2. **Open an invoice**
3. **Tap "Download Invoice PDF"**
4. **Wait for generation**
5. **Share dialog opens** ✅

The error should be gone and PDF download should work smoothly!

## Status

✅ **Fixed**  
✅ Import changed to use legacy API  
✅ No code refactoring needed  
✅ Download functionality preserved  
✅ Ready to test
