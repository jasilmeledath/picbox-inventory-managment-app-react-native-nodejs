# Database Backup Feature - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Added a comprehensive database backup feature to the Settings screen, allowing users to download a complete backup of all database records in JSON format for safety and data migration purposes.

---

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Backup Controller
**File:** `backend/src/controllers/backup.controller.js`

#### Functions:

**`downloadBackup(req, res)`**
- Fetches all data from 8 collections: Users, Employees, Products, Jobs, Invoices, Payments, Company Credentials, Counters
- Creates a structured JSON backup with metadata
- Returns timestamped JSON file for download
- Includes record counts and backup version

**`getBackupInfo(req, res)`**
- Returns statistics about database without fetching full data
- Provides total record counts per collection
- Lightweight endpoint for displaying backup info before download

#### Backup JSON Structure:
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "backup_date": "2025-10-13T12:00:00.000Z",
    "backup_version": "1.0.0",
    "database_name": "picbox",
    "total_collections": 8,
    "record_counts": {
      "users": 5,
      "employees": 15,
      "products": 50,
      "jobs": 30,
      "invoices": 45,
      "payments": 20,
      "companyCredentials": 2,
      "counters": 1
    }
  },
  "data": {
    "users": [...],
    "employees": [...],
    "products": [...],
    // ... all collection data
  }
}
```

### 2. Backup Routes
**File:** `backend/src/routes/backup.routes.js`

- **GET** `/api/backup/info` - Get backup statistics
- **GET** `/api/backup/download` - Download full backup JSON

Both routes are protected with authentication middleware.

### 3. Main App Integration
**File:** `backend/src/index.js`

Added route:
```javascript
app.use('/api/backup', require('./routes/backup.routes'));
```

---

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. Backup Service
**File:** `frontend/src/api/backupService.ts`

TypeScript service with:
- `getBackupInfo()` - Fetch backup statistics
- `downloadBackup()` - Download complete backup

#### TypeScript Interfaces:
```typescript
interface BackupInfo {
  total_collections: number;
  total_records: number;
  collections: {
    users: number;
    employees: number;
    products: number;
    jobs: number;
    invoices: number;
    payments: number;
    companyCredentials: number;
    counters: number;
  };
  last_checked: string;
}

interface BackupData {
  metadata: {
    backup_date: string;
    backup_version: string;
    database_name: string;
    total_collections: number;
    record_counts: {...};
  };
  data: any;
}
```

### 2. Settings Screen Updates
**File:** `frontend/src/screens/settings/SettingsScreen.tsx`

#### New Features:

**State Variables:**
```typescript
const [backupInfo, setBackupInfo] = useState<BackupInfo | null>(null);
const [isDownloadingBackup, setIsDownloadingBackup] = useState(false);
```

**Functions:**
- `loadBackupInfo()` - Fetches and displays backup statistics on screen load
- `handleDownloadBackup()` - Downloads backup, saves to device, and shares

#### UI Components:

**Backup Info Display:**
- Shows total records and collections count
- Displays breakdown by collection type (Employees, Products, Jobs, Invoices)
- Real-time statistics

**Download Button:**
- Primary action button with download icon
- Shows loading state during download ("Downloading...")
- Disabled while downloading

#### Download Process:
1. Fetches backup data from API
2. Converts to formatted JSON string
3. Saves to device filesystem using `expo-file-system`
4. Opens native share dialog using `expo-sharing`
5. Shows success alert with filename and record count

**Example Alert:**
```
Success!
Backup downloaded successfully!

File: picbox_backup_2025-10-13T12-00-00.json
Total Records: 168
```

## Dependencies Added

### Frontend:
- `expo-file-system` - For saving JSON to device storage
- `expo-sharing` - For native file sharing dialog

Install with:
```bash
cd frontend
npx expo install expo-file-system expo-sharing
```

## API Endpoints

### GET `/api/backup/info`
**Description:** Get backup statistics  
**Authentication:** Required (JWT Token)  
**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "total_collections": 8,
    "total_records": 168,
    "collections": {
      "users": 2,
      "employees": 15,
      "products": 50,
      "jobs": 30,
      "invoices": 45,
      "payments": 20,
      "companyCredentials": 2,
      "counters": 4
    },
    "last_checked": "2025-10-13T12:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

### GET `/api/backup/download`
**Description:** Download complete database backup  
**Authentication:** Required (JWT Token)  
**Response:** JSON file download with filename `picbox_backup_YYYY-MM-DDTHH-mm-ss.json`

---

## Security Considerations

### ‚úÖ Authentication Required
Both endpoints require valid JWT token - only authenticated users can access

### ‚úÖ Sensitive Data Handling
- Passwords are already hashed in database (bcrypt)
- JWT secrets are not included in backup
- API keys and tokens (if any) should be excluded (currently not storing any)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Recommended Improvements
1. Add admin-only check (currently any authenticated user can download)
2. Consider encrypting backup files
3. Add audit logging for backup downloads
4. Implement backup retention/versioning on server side

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features:
1. **Scheduled Auto-Backups** - Daily/weekly automatic backups to cloud
2. **Backup Restore** - Upload and restore from backup JSON
3. **Selective Backup** - Choose specific collections to backup
4. **Compression** - Gzip compress large backups
5. **Email Backups** - Automatically email backups to admin
6. **Backup History** - List of previous backups with restore points
7. **Incremental Backups** - Only backup changes since last backup
8. **Cloud Storage Integration** - Direct upload to Google Drive/Dropbox

---
