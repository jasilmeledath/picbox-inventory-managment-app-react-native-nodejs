# Testing the Login Screen

## 🎉 Congratulations! Your Login Screen is Now Functional

### What Just Changed

The Login Screen now has:
- ✅ Full form validation (email format, password length)
- ✅ Real-time error messages
- ✅ Connection to authStore (Zustand)
- ✅ Beautiful UI with theme colors
- ✅ Demo credentials button
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Error handling

---

## 🧪 Testing the Login Screen

### Step 1: Start the Backend (Required)

Open a new terminal and start your backend server:

```bash
cd /Users/jasilm/Desktop/picboxfullstack/backend
npm start
```

You should see:
```
🚀 Server running on port 3000
✅ Connected to MongoDB
```

**Important**: The backend MUST be running for login to work!

---

### Step 2: Test on Your Device (Expo Go)

Your Expo app should **automatically reload** and show the new login screen!

If not, shake your device and tap "Reload".

---

### Step 3: Try Demo Login

You'll see the new login screen with:
- PICBOX logo (📦)
- Email and password fields
- "Use Demo Credentials" button
- Blue info box with credentials

**Option A: Tap "Use Demo Credentials" Button**
- This auto-fills: `admin@example.com` / `password123`
- Then tap "Login"

**Option B: Manual Entry**
- Email: `admin@example.com`
- Password: `password123`
- Tap "Login"

---

### Step 4: What Should Happen

#### ✅ **Success Path** (Backend Running):
1. Button shows loading spinner
2. App connects to backend
3. JWT token is stored securely
4. **You're automatically navigated to Dashboard!**
5. You'll see the bottom tabs
6. You can navigate between screens

#### ❌ **Error Path** (Backend Not Running):
You'll see error message:
```
⚠️ Unable to connect to server.
Please check if the backend is running.
```

#### ❌ **Wrong Credentials**:
Alert popup:
```
Login Failed
Invalid email or password
```

## 📱 Physical Device Connection Issue?

If you're testing on a physical device (not simulator), the backend URL needs your computer's IP address.

### Find Your IP Address:

```bash
# macOS
ipconfig getifaddr en0
```

### Update API Base URL:

Edit: `frontend/src/api/client.ts`

Change from:
```typescript
export const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:3000/api';
```

To (replace with YOUR IP):
```typescript
export const API_BASE_URL = 'http://192.168.1.100:3000/api';
```

Save, and the app will reload.

## 🧪 Form Validation Tests

Try these to see validation in action:

### Test 1: Empty Fields
- Leave email and password empty
- Tap "Login"
- ❌ Should show: "Email is required" and "Password is required"

### Test 2: Invalid Email Format
- Email: `notanemail`
- Password: `anything`
- Tap "Login"
- ❌ Should show: "Please enter a valid email"

### Test 3: Short Password
- Email: `test@example.com`
- Password: `123`
- Tap "Login"
- ❌ Should show: "Password must be at least 6 characters"

### Test 4: Valid Format, Wrong Credentials
- Email: `wrong@example.com`
- Password: `wrongpass`
- Tap "Login"
- ❌ Should show alert: "Login Failed"

### Test 5: Correct Credentials
- Tap "Use Demo Credentials"
- Tap "Login"
- ✅ Should navigate to Dashboard!

---

## 🎯 After Successful Login

Once logged in, you'll see:
- **Dashboard tab** (active)
- Bottom navigation with 5 tabs
- All tabs are accessible
- Each screen still shows placeholder content

**Next Steps**: Build the Dashboard screen to show real financial data!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Unable to connect to server"
**Solutions**:
1. Make sure backend is running (`npm start` in backend folder)
2. Check backend terminal for errors
3. Verify backend shows "Server running on port 3000"
4. If on physical device, update API_BASE_URL with your IP

### Issue: "Login Failed" with demo credentials
**Solutions**:
1. Check if backend has seed data: `cd backend && npm run seed`
2. Verify MongoDB is connected
3. Check backend terminal for error logs
4. Try creating a new user via Postman first

### Issue: App doesn't reload after changes
**Solutions**:
1. Shake device → Tap "Reload"
2. In Expo terminal, press `r` to reload
3. If stuck, press `c` to clear cache and restart

### Issue: "Network request failed"
**Solutions**:
1. Device and computer must be on **same WiFi**
2. Check firewall isn't blocking port 3000
3. For physical device, use computer's IP address (not localhost)

### Issue: Keyboard covers inputs
**Solutions**:
- Already handled with `KeyboardAvoidingView`
- If still having issues, tap outside keyboard to scroll

## 📊 What's Next?

Now that login works, here's the development priority:

### 1. Build Dashboard Screen ⏭️ **Next**
- Fetch financial metrics
- Display revenue, expenses, profit cards
- Show pending wages
- Recent jobs list

### 2. Test Full Auth Flow
- Login → See Dashboard
- Logout (from Settings) → Back to Login
- Token persistence (close app, reopen → still logged in)

### 3. Build Products Screen
- List products
- Search functionality
- Add/Edit/Delete products

### 4. Continue with remaining screens
- Employees (with payment recording)
- Jobs (with wage calculations)
- Settings

## 💡 Development Tips

### Hot Reload is Active
- Save any file → App reloads instantly
- No need to rebuild or restart

### Test Error States
- Disconnect WiFi → See network error
- Stop backend → See connection error
- Use wrong credentials → See validation

### Use React DevTools
- Shake device → "Debug"
- Opens Chrome DevTools
- See console.log statements
- Inspect state

### Check Zustand Store
After login, check auth state:
```typescript
// In any screen
const { user, isAuthenticated } = useAuthStore();
console.log('User:', user);
console.log('Auth:', isAuthenticated);
```
